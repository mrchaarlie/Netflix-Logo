I was watching a Netflix trailer, and wanted to re-create the line animation from the video.

Although it's not perfect, it's quite similar. The only thing that the [original](https://youtu.be/gXg2_yExgVY?t=88) has that's different, is the shadow from the letter segments only appear on the segments beneath it and not on the background. This could be resolved by applying a complicated clip-mask to each segment however.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
